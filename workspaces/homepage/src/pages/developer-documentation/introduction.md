Cogito is an open-source identity management system. For a quick introduction,
visit [cogito.mobi]. Our source code lives on
[GitHub](https://github.com/philips-software/cogito). You may want to start by
following the [Tutorial](/developer-documentation/tutorial) or by browsing
through the rest of this documentation.

Cogito is still very much a work in progress. If you'd like to contribute, then
you're more than welcome to. We even wrote
[a guide](https://github.com/philips-software/cogito/blob/master/Contributing.md)
to help you get started on your first contribution. If you need any help, feel
free to reach out to us on [Slack](https://philips-software-slackin.now.sh/).
