/// A ReRxSwift Connection that manages the mapping between ReSwift application state
/// and ReSwift actions on the one hand, and view controller props and actions on the
/// other hand.
///
/// In order to use this, you have to make your view controller conform to
/// `Connectable` and add a `Connection` instance. In your view controller
/// you need to call `connect()` and `disconnect()` at the right time.
///
/// Examples
/// ========
/// The folder [`Example`](https://github.com/svdo/ReRxSwift/tree/master/Example)
/// contains example of how to use this.
///
/// Usage
/// =====
/// 1. Create an extension to your view controller to make it `Connectable`,
/// defining the `Props` and `Actions` that your view controller needs:
///
///     ```swift
///     extension MyViewController: Connectable {
///         struct Props {
///             let text: String
///         }
///         struct Actions {
///             let updatedText: (String) -> Void
///         }
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 2. Define how your state is mapped to the above `Props` type:
///
///     ```swift
///     private let mapStateToProps = { (appState: AppState) in
///         return MyViewController.Props(
///             text: appState.content
///         )
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 3. Define the actions that are dispatched:
///
///     ```swift
///     private let mapDispatchToActions = { (dispatch: @escaping DispatchFunction) in
///         return MyViewController.Actions(
///             updatedText: { newText in dispatch(SetContent(newContent: newText)) }
///         )
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 4. Define the connection and hook it up:
///
///     ```swift
///     class MyViewController: UIViewController {
///         @IBOutlet weak var textField: UITextField!
///
///         let connection = Connection(
///             store: store,
///             mapStateToProps: mapStateToProps,
///             mapDispatchToActions: mapDispatchToActions
///         )
///
///         override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
///             super.viewWillAppear(animated)
///             connection.connect()
///         }
///
///         override func viewDidDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
///             super.viewDidDisappear(animated)
///             connection.disconnect()
///         }
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 5. Bind the text field's text, using a Swift 4 key path to refer to the
/// `text` property of `Props`:
///
///     ```swift
///     override func viewDidLoad() {
///         super.viewDidLoad()
///         connection.bind(\Props.text, to: textField.rx.text)
///     }
///     ```
///
/// 6. Call the action:
///
///     ```swift
///     @IBAction func editingChanged(_ sender: UITextField) {
///         actions.updatedText(sender.text ?? "")
///     }
///     ```

public class Connection<State: StateType, Props, Actions>: StoreSubscriber {
    /// The RxSwift `BehaviorRelay` that holds your view controller props.
    /// Normally you don't use this this directly, you use it through `Connectable.props`
    /// instead. This variable is public so that you can use it for unit testing.
