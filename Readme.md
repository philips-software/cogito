Cogito
===============

Cogito is a set of components and services that let you easily incorporate self-sovereign identity into your own solutions. A self-sovereign identity is an identity that is owned and controlled by the user. This is in contrast to (unfortunately) common situation where user identity is de-facto owned by one of the (Open) Identity providers. A self-sovereign identity might be used everywhere where users need to be identified: be it a simple online service where each user has an account and therefore needs to be distinguishable from other users, or be it a blockchain transaction that the user has to sign. Most importantly, the self-sovereign identity stays with the user - your identity cannot be taken from you, because you and only you own it.

> We are working hard to improve documentation. We are not yet there but we are almost there. Within next weeks the most important stuff will be connected so that you can start using Cogito and contribute to it. Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions.
