Cogito
===============

⚠ Deprecation ⚠
----------------

We've learned a lot from creating Cogito, and decided to apply our learnings in
a new project called [Identity Box](https://idbox.online/). Since we're only a
small team, that unfortunately means that we won't be updating Cogito for the
foreseeable future. Should you be in need of updates to Cogito, feel free to
reach out to us on [Slack](https://philips-software-slackin.now.sh), and we'll
see what we can do to help you out.

Introduction
------------

Cogito is an open-source identity management system. For a quick introduction
visit [cogito.mobi](https://cogito.mobi/) or read the [developer
documentation](https://cogito.mobi/developer-documentation/introduction).
